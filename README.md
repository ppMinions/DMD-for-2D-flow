# Dynamic Mode Decomposition for 2-D flow
Author:       ppMinions

A python code for Dynamic Mode Decomposition of 2D flow. The input and output
files of cfd solutions are **DAT** file in Tecplot.  
The package contains source codes and the test cases of a cylinder flow at Reynolds number 100.  
The data directory contains the 150 snapshot of the cfd solution files with Tecplot subzone data type.  
The results directory contains the 20 mode results of the DMD.  
The **macro script** is used in Tecplot to convert the subzone file to data file.
